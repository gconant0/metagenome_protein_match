# metagenome_protein_match
Tools for matching translated metagenomic reads to protein databases. Requires the SeqAn header library (version 2.4 or later): https://github.com/seqan/seqan.  You will need to edit the Makefile to point to the location of these headers. For example:
INCLUDE = -I/home/gavinconant/software/seqan-master/include
